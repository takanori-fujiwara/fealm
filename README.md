## Feature Learning for Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction toward Maximal Extraction of Hidden Patterns

About
-----
* The implementation of FEALM, FEALM-UMAP, and NSD from: Feature Learning for Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction toward Maximal Extraction of Hidden Patterns. Takanori Fujiwara, Yun-Hsin Kuo, Anders Ynnerman, and Kwan-Liu Ma. In Proc. PacificVis, 2023. [arXiv Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13891))

* Demonstration video: https://takanori-fujiwara.github.io/s/fealm/index.html

* Features
  * Feature learning framework, FEALM, for nonliner dimensionality reduction methods. 
  
  * Exemplifying method of FEALM for UMAP (FEALM-UMAP)

  * Various graph dissimilarity measures, including neighbor-disimilarity measure (NSD)

  * Implementation of "Optimal Sets of Projections of High-Dimensional Data" [Lehmann and Theisel, 2016]

  * Generation code of the 2-spheres and 3-class attribute data, which is designed to illustrate nonlinear dimensionality reductionâ€™s sensitiveness to trivial disturbance to manifolds

Setup
-----

### Requirements
* Python3.10 (Python3.11 is not supported due to the implementation issues in `umap`)
* Note: Tested on macOS Ventura and Windows 10.

### Setup
* Install FEALM

  * Download/Clone this repository

  * Move to the downloaded repository, then:

    `python3.10 -m pip install .`

* You can test with sample.py. To run, sample.py you need to install additonal packages.

    `python3.10 -m pip install matplotlib sklearn`

### Usage
* Examples can be found in "sample.py" and "case_studies".
* API documentation can be found in "fealm/fealm.py".

* Currently, due to the conflict between UMAP and Pathos libraries, a specific loading order of modules is required (see sample.py).
